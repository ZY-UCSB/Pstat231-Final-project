Here is the original data set download from Kaggle. (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory?resource=download)

We will not directly use the original data set as our final data set. We will process the original data in R.

If you need the information about our final data set `coins`, please check the `processed` folder, where we have the codebook for our final data set.

There are 11 csv files in `unprocessed` folder. Each file is the historical trading date of different kinds of Cryptocurrencies with the name on it.

All the files are consists of the same variables.
